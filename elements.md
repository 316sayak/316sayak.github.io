I find it extremely hard to introduce myself, like, who am I? A mere name? 

Anyway, if you are here, you already know it. What you may not know is, I am extremely scared of cockroaches. There, a 'personal' information for you. Not a vermin, so I can be in a Kafka novel any day of the week. 

I grew up in Santragachi, a small town in the outskirt of Kolkata. Coming from a lower-middle class family, you did not think twice before enrolling your kids in a government, Bengali medium schools back in the early 2000's. And boy, did I have fun. Yes, you do have bullies in these schools as well, but you get friends. Friends, not giving two fucks about your class, caste, creed. Ramkrishna Shikshalay, my first 'primary' school, gave me friends who introduced me to Rupam Islam (one of the greatest contemporary Bangla rock singer-songwriter), and made me conscious about my class (may be the introduction to the Soviet literature from those Bengali translated books of Praduga Publications played a role as well). 

2009, the sixth standard, was the time for a change according to my ambitious and caring mother. I had to appear for the admission test for Hindu School, one of the best government school in Kolkata. I got in. I got in the day my grandmother died. 

The next 6 years of schooling was a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. I met my best friend (who is almost out of contact these days, for definite reasons). My mother introduced me to the world of literature, father introduced me to the world of politics, and my school introduced me to the city of Kolkata. They say, it is the city of joy. May be, but I don't know if joyous is the adjective to describe the ambience of the north Kolkata alleys. Full of life, yes. But life is not always joyous, is it? 

2015 was the time for college. Scottish Church College, Kolkata. Physics Hons. I had been in Jalpaiguri Govt. Engineering College for 7 days before that, because I was not good enough to get into a Physics degree in a 'reputed' college initially. But as luck would have it, I got into Scottish in the second counselling (the admission procedure). Left that godforsaken Engineering degree for good, and got into the place that would shape me differently in the next three years. My college days are the most complex time I have faced, because I can not put the three years in any bracket whatsoever. Learnt a lot, academicaaly, true. But this post should not be about academics anyway. One of the most vivid memories of my college life is the creation of <a href='https://bohubreehi.wordpress.com/'> "Bohubreehi" </a> : which turned out to be just another failed attempt to create a web-magazine among thousand others in Kolkata. But I loved every bit of it. 

I got into the Masters program in Physics in IIT Guwahati in 2018. The next one and a half year (not two, screw you Covid) was the best time of my life, hands down. Great place, great people, and above all, the best place to drown your sorrows with a Coke and rum at the end of semesters! In addition to improving my drinking skills, I also became a better football player, culminating in winning the intra-hostel football tournament (Ba-Liga) as a proud accolade! :P 

So, that is it, I guess.. 

I love music, movies, politics, drinking with friends, and football. Oh, did I mention looking at spectra?
